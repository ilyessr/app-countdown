This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## Statement:

Create a countdown timer (a simple rectangle with a number in it).
The counter starts at 40.
Every second, the counter decreases by 1.

The counter always displays a 2-digit number (e.g. 09).
- In the interval ]20, 40] : rectangle with blue background
- In the interval ]12, 20] : rectangle with orange background
- In the interval [0, 12] : rectangle with red background
At 0 the countdown is blocked at 0.

The code must present a test(s) checking the background color of the rectangle according to the
number displayed.

## To go further :
- Create 2 other counters with the same component, which start respectively at 45 and 50
- Set up a start / pause button.
